Milestone Game - Typescript edition

Converted vanilla JS game to typescript as practice.

Still need to implement backend for rendering other than locally and improving functionality.

Need to implement/improve styling.  

This is a simple black jack game with a tropical casino theme that allows users to play one-on-one against the house.

If you win, the house will offer you a drink.  Accepting the alcoholic drink will blur the screen.  

In the future, I will add functionality where accepting the drink will initially improve your luck in completing blackjack on selecting to hit.  Then, as in real life, it may begin to hamper your luck/decision making.
